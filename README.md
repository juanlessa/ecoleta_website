# Ecoleta
Ecoleta is a website created at the NLW event
![Site presentation](public/site-presentation.png)

## Event proposal
The purpose of the event was to develop, in one week, a website to locate selective collection points
## Solution developed
As a solution I developed a responsive website, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I developed the server in node.js using the express module, and the nunjucks module to serve the html dynamically. To store the information of the collection points I developed an SQLite database.
## Setup
To run and test this solution you need:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the repository folder on terminal.
3. Run
    $ npm install, 
to install node_modules.
4. Run 
    $ npm start,
to start the application server.
5. Access this link in your browser: http://localhost:3000
